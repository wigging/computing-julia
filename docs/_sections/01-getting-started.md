## Getting started

To get started, visit the main Julia website at <https://julialang.org> and follow their download and installation instructions. Julia is available for macOS, various flavors of Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. After installation, read the sections below to learn more about the various features of the language.

Some of the code examples on this site use the `julia> ` prompt to represent a line of executed code. This prompt is part of the Julia REPL which is accessed by typing the `julia` command in the terminal. As demonstrated in the code block shown below, `julia> x = 2.5` assigns `2.5` to the `x` variable. The execution of this line displays a value of `2.5` in the REPL. Another example is adding two numbers such as `5 + 4.8` to get a result of `9.8`.

```julia
julia> x = 2.5
2.5

julia> 5 + 4.8
9.8
```
